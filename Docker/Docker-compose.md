[`Docker-Compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) é uma ferramenta para definir e rodar aplicações Docker multi-container. Com compose, usa-se arquivo `YAML` para configurar os serviços das aplicações para, então, com apenas um comando, poder criar, inicial todos os serviços necessários.

Compose works in all environments: production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows. It also has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:

- Start, stop, and rebuild services
- View the status of running services
- Stream the log output of running services
- Run a one-off command on a service

The key features of Compose that make it effective are:
[Instalando](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
